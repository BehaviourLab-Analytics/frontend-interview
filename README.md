# Behaviour Lab Frontend Technical Interview

Congratulations on making it to the Behaviour Lab take-home task! We know these can be long and tedious but this one is different - please spend no longer than 2-3 hours on both tasks combined and try to have fun.

Please fork this repository, and complete each task in it's own subfolder.

Once you've finished, submit the project to `jobs@behaviourlab.com` and `yannis@behaviourlab.com`:

Please make this repo private and invite `yp717` to the repository.

## What are we testing?

Let’s cut to the chase - candidates hate it when the tests are confusing and its not clear what they’re for. We like to be transparent, so for full disclosure, this test aims to evaluate a candidates ability:

- to solve and break down problems
- to write great JavaScript and React code
- to write clear and understandable code
- to develop performant solutions without compromising readability

## Advice

Don't overcomplicate it and build the best solution you can within the time constraints. Goodluck!
